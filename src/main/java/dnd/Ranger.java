public class Ranger extends Character {

//    Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging beasts and monstrosities,
//    terrible giants, and deadly dragons.
//    They learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.
//    Rangers focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful against their specific favored foes.
//
//    Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does.
//    Their spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on the grim task of protecting the borderlands.
